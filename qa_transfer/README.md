Objective: To create a question answering system that can
synthesize information from online resources such as textbooks
and syllabi, and respond to questions about those resources.
In the long term, we view this as an extremely useful tool
for Cornell students that automatically answers easier questions
asked on Piazza. In the short term, we will focus on creating
a system to answer questions from the 
[SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset.
